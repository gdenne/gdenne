<H2>Hi, I'm Gaz, a Technical Writer at Instructure </H2>

In my career, I've always been passionate about two main things â€“ technology and helping people. They get me out of bed each morning, excited for a new day. My experience spans across solution engineer roles, technical writing, coaching and training, and content strategy. Ever curious, there's nothing I enjoy more than diving deep into how things work and how to make technology even better for customers through both external and internal process and policy. Some of my main areas of interest are cybersecurity, compliance, privacy, accessibility, and now, of course, AI.
