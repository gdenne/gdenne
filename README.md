<H2>Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Gaz, Principal Technical Writer at Instructure <img src="https://github.com/gdenne/gdenne/blob/main/content/inst_bug.png" alt="Instructure Logo"> </H2>

I write global documentation and sales/marketing content covering a range of technical areas including security, compliance, APIs, and cloud architecture. My experience spans across solution engineer roles, technical writing, coaching and training, and content strategy. 

<p>Ever curious, there's nothing I enjoy more than diving deep into how things work and how to make technology even better for customers through both external and internal process and policy. Some of my main areas of interest are cybersecurity, privacy, product, accessibility, disaster recovery, and now, of course, my focus is on AI ðŸ‘€ </p>
